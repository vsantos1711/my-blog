## Description
Welcome to my personal portfolio, a platform built with Next.js and TailwindCSS, specifically designed for developers who want to showcase their work in a dynamic and 100% integrated way with GitHub.

#### Main features:
* **Direct Connection with GitHub:** All my posts and projects are linked to my GitHub repositories. Any updates made to my repositories will automatically be reflected in the portfolio.

* **Dynamic Portfolio/Blog:** Each repository becomes a post on my portfolio/blog. Information is extracted directly from the README.md files of my repositories, displaying details about projects, challenges, and studies.

- **"About Me" and "CV" Sections:** Includes an "About Me" section where you can learn more about me, and a "CV" section where you can view my skills and experiences!

- **No Database or API:** No database or API needed. All content displayed on the website is hosted directly on GitHub, eliminating the need for additional databases or APIs. Simple and efficient!
